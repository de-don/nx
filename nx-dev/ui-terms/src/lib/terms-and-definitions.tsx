        <strong>Disclosing Party</strong>&quot;) provides to the other party

        this Agreement, whether orally or in writing, that is designated as
        confidential or that reasonably should be considered to be confidential
        given the nature of the information and/or the circumstances of

        restriction on use or disclosure. For clarity, the Software and the

        Data will be deemed your Confidential Information. The Receiving Party
        will not use or disclose any Confidential Information of the Disclosing
        Party except as necessary to perform its obligations or exercise its
        rights under this Agreement; provided that Nx may use and modify your
        Confidential Information in deidentified form for purposes of developing
        and deriving Aggregated Data. The Receiving Party may disclose
        Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party only: (A) to those of
        its employees, contractors, agents and advisors who have a bona fide
        need to know such Confidential Information to perform under this
        Agreement and who are bound by written agreements with use and
        nondisclosure restrictions at least as protective of the Confidential
        Information as those set forth in this Agreement, or (B) as such
        disclosure may be required by the order or requirement of a court,
        administrative agency or other governmental body, subject to the
        Receiving Party providing to the Disclosing Party reasonable written
        notice to allow the Disclosing Party to seek a protective order or
        otherwise contest the disclosure.

        property rights.
      </p>

      <h3>(b) Exclusions</h3>
      <p>
        Nx’s obligations under Section 10(a) will not apply if the underlying
        third-party claim arises from (i) your breach of this Agreement,
        negligence, willful misconduct or fraud; (ii) modifications to the
        Software by anyone other than Nx; or (iii) combinations of the Software
        of with software, data or materials not provided by Nx, including,

      </p>

      <h3>IP remedies</h3>
      <p>
        If Nx reasonably believes the Software (or any component thereof) could
        infringe any third party’s intellectual property rights, Nx may, at its
        sole option and expense: (i) procure the right for you to continue using
        the Software (or any infringing component thereof) to make it
        non-infringing without materially reducing its functionality; or (ii)
        replace the Software (or any infringing component thereof) with a
        non-infringing alternative that is functionally equivalent in all
        material respects. If the foregoing remedies are not available to Nx on
        commercially reasonable terms, then Nx may suspend or terminate your use
        of the Software upon notice to you. The rights and remedies set forth in
        this Section 10 shall constitute your sole and exclusive remedy for any
        intellectual property infringement by the Software.
      </p>
      <h3>Your indemnification</h3>
      <p>
        Subject to Section 10(e), you will defend and pay all damages finally
        awarded against Nx pursuant to a final, valid and binding judgment or
        order or a final settlement agreement with respect to any claim, suit or
        proceeding brought by a third party against Nx arising from: (i) any of
        Your Data stored, collected, hosted or transmitted in violation of
        applicable laws, rules and regulations or this Agreement; and (ii) any
        breach of the restrictions set forth in Section 2(b).
      </p>
      <h3>Indemnification procedures</h3>
      <p>
        The party seeking defense and indemnity (the &quot;
        <strong>Indemnified Party</strong>&quot;) will promptly notify the other
        party (the &quot;<strong>Indemnifying Party</strong>
        &quot;) of any and all such claims and will reasonably cooperate with
        the Indemnifying Party with the defense and/or settlement thereof. The
        Indemnifying Party will have the sole right to conduct the defense of
        any claim for which the Indemnifying Party is responsible hereunder
        (provided that the Indemnifying Party may not settle any claim without
        the Indemnified Party&apos;s prior written approval unless the
        settlement unconditionally releases the Indemnified Party from all
        liability, does not require any admission by the Indemnified Party, and
        does not place restrictions upon the Indemnified Party&apos;s business,
        products or services). The Indemnified Party may participate in the
        defense or settlement of any such claim at its own expense and with its
        own choice of counsel or, if the Indemnifying Party refuses to fulfill
        its obligation of defense, the Indemnified Party may defend itself and
        seek reimbursement from the Indemnifying Party.

      <h3>(c) Waiver</h3>
      <p>
        Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, either party’s failure
        to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver
        of future enforcement of that or any other provision. No waiver of any
        provision of this Agreement will be effective unless it is in writing
        and signed by the party granting the waiver.
      </p>
      <h3>(d) Severability</h3>
      <p>
        If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, illegal or
        unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent
        permitted by law, given the fundamental intentions of the parties, and
        the remaining provisions of this Agreement will remain in full force and
        effect.
      </p>
      <h3>(e) Governing law; Jurisdiction</h3>
      <p>
        This Agreement will be governed by and construed in accordance with the
        laws of the State of California without giving effect to any principles
        of conflict of laws that would lead to the application of the laws of
        another jurisdiction. The parties expressly agree that the United
        Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will
        not apply. Any legal action or proceeding arising under this Agreement
        will be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in
        the Northern District of California and the parties irrevocably consent
        to the personal jurisdiction and venue therein.
      </p>
      <h3>(f) Assignment</h3>
      <p>
        Nx may freely assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement.
        You may not assign or transfer this Agreement, by operation of law or
        otherwise, without Nx’s prior written consent; provided, however, that
        you may assign your rights or delegate your obligations, in whole or in
        part, without such consent, to (i) one or more of your affiliates, or
        (ii) a third party that succeeds to all or substantially all of your
        business and assets relating to the subject matter of this Agreement,
        whether by sale, merger, operation of law or otherwise; provided that,
        in either case of (i) and (ii) such affiliate or other entity (as
        applicable) agrees in writing to assume all of your obligations
        hereunder. Any attempt to assign or transfer this Agreement without such
        consent will be void. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement is
        binding upon and will inure to the benefit of each of the parties and
        their respective successors and permitted assigns.
      </p>
      <h3>(g) Equitable relief</h3>
      <p>
        Each party hereby agrees that any breach of this Agreement may cause
        such other party to incur irreparable harm and significant injury that
        would be difficult to ascertain and would not be compensable by damages
        alone. Accordingly, each party agrees that, in addition to any other
        rights and remedies that the non-breaching party may have at law or
        otherwise with respect to such a breach, the non-breaching party will
        have the right to seek specific performance, injunction or other
        appropriate equitable relief.
      </p>
      <h3>(h) No third-party beneficiaries</h3>
      <p>
        Unless otherwise expressly provided, no provisions of this Agreement are
        intended or will be construed to confer upon or give to any person or
        entity, other than the parties, any rights, remedies or other benefits
        under or by reason of this Agreement.
